Data obtained by imaging mass cytometry allows the identification of cell-cell interactions and spatial tissue structure.
Here, we will highlight the different strategies for spatial data analysis including:

1. low-level visualization strategies
2. statistical neighbourhood analysis
3. Computing the distance between objects
4. further spatial statistics (e.g. Ripley's K)

First, we will read in all needed libraries and the ```SingleCellExperiment``` object generated in the previous step.

```{r}
library(SingleCellExperiment)
sce <- readRDS("data/extdata/sce.rds")
```
