# An introduction to imaging mass cytometry

Imaging mass cytometry utilizes metal-tagged antibodies to detect up to 40 proteins in tissues.
As such, it is a leading technology to perform highly-multiplexed imaging (HMI) particularly suited to profile small (1mm<sup>2</sup>) areas of tissue slices across hundreds of samples.

## What it is

IMC has first been published by the Bodenmiller laboratory in 2014[^fn1].
Since then it has been commercialised by Fluidigm<sup>&reg;</sup> and is now distributed as the Hyperion<sup>TM</sup> imaging system (documentation is availabel [here](https://www.fluidigm.com/binaries/content/documents/fluidigm/resources/hyperion-imaging-system-ug-400311-a2/hyperion-imaging-system-ug-400311-a2/fluidigm%3Afile)).
Similar to other HMI technologies such as MIBI[^fn2], CyCIF[^fn3], CODEX[^fn4] and SABER[^fn5], IMC captures the spatial expression of multiple proteins in parallel.
With 1&mu;m resolution, IMC is able to detect cytoplasmic and nuclear localisation of proteins. 
The default ablation frequency of IMC is set to 200Hz, meaning a 1mm<sup>2</sup> area can be imaged within ~1.5 hours.

## How it works

Requirements: tissues cut to 2-6&mu;m thickness, Antibody panel conjugated with metals
The whole process of acquiring IMC data can be broadly split into a (i) staining and (ii) imaging part.

### Staining

Antibody panel conjugated with metals
Is there a classic staining protocol?

### Data acquisition

Explain panoramas
Region selection

## How the data looks like
