# Downstream analysis of IMC data

This page gives a brief overview of the common steps for downstream analysis of IMC data.
For a more detailed workflow using example data, please refer to the [IMC data analysis](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/IMCDataAnalysis) repository (under development).

The analysis described here relies on the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) framework for single-cell analysis. 
The [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/) book gives a good introduction into general single-cell analyses tasks.
While the book mainly focuses on single-cell RNA sequencing data, most concepts (e.g. data handling, clustering and visualization) can be applied to single-cell data extracted from IMC.
The book offers a [basic](https://bioconductor.org/books/3.14/OSCA.basic/) and [advanced](https://bioconductor.org/books/3.14/OSCA.advanced/) version.

## Reading in the data

The [imcRtools](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imcRtools)[^fn1] package allows reading in data generated by `steinbock` (using [read_steinbock](https://bodenmillergroup.github.io/imcRtools/reference/read_steinbock.html)) or the IMC Segmentation Pipeline (using [read_cpout](https://bodenmillergroup.github.io/imcRtools/reference/read_cpout.html)) for downstream analysis in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/). 
Single-cell data (mean intensities per cell and channel, morphological features and locations, and spatial object graphs) are read into [SpatialExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SpatialExperiment.html) or [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html) objects.

The structure of the read-in objects looks as follows:

* mean intensity per cell and channel are stored in the __counts__ assay of the objects (cells in columns and channels in rows).
* cell-specific morphological features are stored in the __colData__ slot of the objects
* spatial object graphs are stored as edge lists in the __colPair__ slot of the objects

In case of the `SingleCellExperiment` object, the cells' locations are stored in the `colData` slot and for the `SpatialExperiment` containe the cells' locations are stored in the `spatialCoords` slot.

## Spillover correction 

Channel-to-channel spillover can occur between neighboring channels and leads to false signals, which need to be corrected for[^fn2].
Spillover correction is an **optional** step in IMC data analysis and requires a specific experimental setup:

On an agarose slide, metal-tagged antibodies are spotted individually and for each antibody, an individual ROI is ablated. 
Data from individual ROIs can be read-in and processed using [imcRtools](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imcRtools) as explained in the [spillover correction](https://bodenmillergroup.github.io/IMCDataAnalysis/spillover-correction.html) section of [IMC data analysis](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/IMCDataAnalysis) book. After obtaining a spillover matrix, single-cell data can be compensated using the [CATALYST](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/CATALYST/inst/doc/preprocessing.html#compensation) package.

## Quality control

Quality control (QC) is a crucial step to avoid technical artefacts in downstream analyses. 
Broadly speaking, there are two levels of data quality control:

1. **Pixel-level QC:** The first step after image acquisition and pre-processing is the visual assessment of image quality. For this, interactive tools such as [napari-imc](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/napari-imc), [histoCAT](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/histoCAT), [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/), as well as [cytomapper](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cytomapper.html) (see below) can be used. Common considerations when viewing images for the first time are as follows: (i) Are the selected markers detected to be specifically expressed (high signal-to-noise ratio, cell type specificity, adequate maximum intensity per channel, etc.)? (ii) is channel-spillover visually detectable? (iii) Are staining differences detectable between acquisitions? 

2. **Cell-level QC:** After reading in the data (e.g. using `imcRtools`), cell-level QC includes (i) visualizing global staining differences between acquisition or batches (e.g. in form of ridge plots using [dittoSeq](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages//release/bioc/html/dittoSeq.html)); (ii) visualizing marker-to-marker correlations across all cells; (iii) visualizing low-dimensional representations of the data (see below); (iv) visualizing the cell density and cell size distribution per acquisition.
