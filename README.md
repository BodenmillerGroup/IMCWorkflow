# IMC data analysis tools

This repository contains an overview of available tools to use for imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data analysis.

## Image processing

Common tasks for IMC data analysis first include image pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction and data export.
The initial [IMCSegmentationPipeline](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/ImcSegmentationPipeline) was developed to allow
manual image processing for IMC and other multiplexed imaging data.

Building up on the `IMCSegmentationPipeline`, the [steinbock](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/steinbock) framework offers user-friendly processing of multi-channel images and supports different segmentation strategies.

### IMC Segmentation pipeline

The [ImcSegmentationPipeline](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/ImcSegmentationPipeline) uses the [imctools](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imctools) python package to handle IMC data. Custom [CellProfiler plugins](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/ImcPluginsCP) support multi-channel image analysis within [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/). 
In addition, [Ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/) is needed to perform pixel classification.

### steinbock

The [steinbock](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/steinbock) framework uses the [readimc](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/readimc) python package for IMC-specific pre-processing. Image processing can be performed via a command line interface.

## Viewers for IMC data

The raw IMC data files in `MCD` format can be read in and visualized using the [MCD viewer](https://www.fluidigm.com/software) (only supported on Windows).

A [napari](https://napari.org/) plugin is now available to read in raw IMC data files and visualize them in a shared coordinate system:

[napari Docs](https://napari.org/tutorials/index.html)

After processing using the `ImcSegmentationPipeline` or `steinbock`, raw MCD files are converted into single-channel TIFF files which can be read in and visualized using [histoCAT](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/histoCAT). `histoCAT` also allows single-cell and spatial data analysis.

A web-application of `histoCAT` is available at:

## Downstream analysis

After pre-processing and feature extraction, single-cell expression data can be read into R and analysed using standardized approaches.
An overview on how to analyse single-cell data generated by multiplexed imaging can be seen here:

### Reading in data

The [imcRtools](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imcRtools) package allows reading in spatially annotated single-cell data extracted from IMC raw data using the `ImcSegmentationPipeline` or `steinbock`. In R, single-cell data are stored in either a [SpatialExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SpatialExperiment.html) or [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html) object.

### Single-cell analysis

Within the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) project, a number of single-cell analysis tools have been developed. 
The [Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/) book offers an overview on common analysis strategies. Here, we name a number of individual packages for different tasks.

[scran](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scran.html) for graph-based clustering

[scater](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scater.html) for dimensionality reduction and data visualization

[dittoSeq](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/dittoSeq.html) for data visualziation

[CATALYST](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CATALYST.html) for clustering, data visualization and differential analysis

### Spatial analysis

The [imcRtools](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imcRtools) package offers a number of functions to perform spatial analysis of cells extracted from multi-channel images.

### Image visualization

In R, the [cytomapper](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cytomapper.html) package allows pixel- and cell-level visualization of multiplexed imaging data.

### Example datasets 

To access example IMC datasets, we have build the [imcdatasets](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/imcdatasets.html) Bioconductor package.
